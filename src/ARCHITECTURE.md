# `src/` Architecture Map

A guide to where things live and where new code should go. The top-level
layout is conventional (data layer → state → UI); the notes below cover the
non-obvious corners.

```
src/
├── index.tsx          # Entry point: mounts App, runs store migrations
├── setup/             # App bootstrap: App.tsx (routes), config, i18n, PWA, GA

## Conventions

- **Imports** use the `@/` alias (maps to `src/`); avoid deep relative paths.
- **backend/ and utils/ stay React-free**; React state lives in stores/ and
  hooks/.
- **Components used by exactly one page** belong in `pages/parts/<page>/`,
  not `components/`.
- **Ads code** (`pages/parts/home/AdsPart.tsx`, `HomeAd.tsx`) and
  commented-out parts (e.g. `ProgressCleanupPart` in AdminPage) are
  deliberate on/off toggles — do not remove them as "dead code".

## Fork note

This repo is a fork of `xp-technologies-dev/kal-Stream` and merges from
upstream regularly. Avoid moving/renaming files that upstream actively
changes — every rename becomes a merge conflict. Prefer additive changes.
